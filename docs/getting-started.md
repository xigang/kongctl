# Getting Started

Set the `KONG_HOST` environment variable on your machine, KONG_HOST uses the address of your real gateway.

```
export KONG_HOST= http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8001
```

     delete  delete service object
     list    list all services object
     routes  list routes associated to a service

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

Create a service resource object:

```
kongctl service create --help

   --url value              shorthand attribute to set protocol, host, port and path at once
```

example:

```
kongctl service create --name=web --url=http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9999

response body:
{
	"host": "xx.xxx.xxx.xx",
	"created_at": 1553907158,

	"write_timeout": 60000
}
```


### Route Object

The Route entities defines rules to match client requests. Each Route is associated with a Service, and a Service may have multiple Routes associated to it. Every request matching a given Route will be proxied to its associated Service.

```
kongctl route
NAME:
   kongctl route - The kong route object.

USAGE:
   kongctl route command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     create  create route object
     get     retrieve route object
     delete  delete route object
     list    list all routes object

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

Create a route resource object:

```
kongctl route create --h

```


example:

```
kongctl route create --paths=/v1/model --service_id=495fec4e-8fdf-42cd-b4e9-604b3776cfed --protocols=http
{
	"created_at": 1553907462,
	"strip_path": true,
	"hosts": null,
	"preserve_host": false,
	"regex_priority": 0,
	"updated_at": 1553907462,
	"paths": [
		"\/v1\/model"
	],

}
```


### Consumer Object

The Consumer object represents a consumer - or a user - of a Service. You can either rely on Kong as the primary datastore, or you can map the consumer list with your database to keep consistency between Kong and your existing primary datastore.


```
kongctl consumer
NAME:
   kongctl consumer - The kong consumer object.

USAGE:
   kongctl consumer command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     create  create consumer object
     list    list all consumers object
     get     retrieve consumer object
     delete  delete consumer object

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help

```

### Upstream Object

The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to loadbalance incoming requests over multiple services (targets). So for example an upstream named service.v1.xyz for a Service object whose host is service.v1.xyz. Requests for this Service would be proxied to the targets defined within the upstream.

```
kongctl upstream --h
NAME:
   kongctl upstream - The kong upstream object.

USAGE:
   kongctl upstream command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     create  create upstream object
     get     get upstream object
     list    list all upstream object
     delete  delete upstream object

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

example:
```
kongctl upstream create --name="web"

response body:
{
	"healthchecks": {
		"active": {
			"unhealthy": {
				"http_statuses": [
					429,
					404,
					500,
					501,
					502,
					503,
					504,
					505
				],
				"tcp_failures": 0,
				"timeouts": 0,
				"http_failures": 0,
				"interval": 0
			},
			"http_path": "\/",
			"healthy": {
				"http_statuses": [
					200,
					302
				],
				"interval": 0,
				"successes": 0
			},
			"timeout": 1,
			"concurrency": 10
		},
		"passive": {
			"unhealthy": {
				"http_failures": 0,
				"http_statuses": [
					429,
					500,
					503
				],
				"tcp_failures": 0,
				"timeouts": 0

					306,
					307,
					308
				],
				"successes": 0
			}
		}
	},
	"created_at": 1553932148565,
	"hash_on": "none",
	"id": "cf9454f1-ee9b-4444-98cc-78ee467b674f",
	"hash_on_cookie_path": "\/",
	"name": "web",
	"hash_fallback": "none",
	"slots": 1000
}
```


### Target Object

A target is an ip address/hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be dynamically added. Changes are effectuated on the fly.


```
kongctl target --h
NAME:
   kongctl target - The kong target object.

USAGE:
   kongctl target command [command options] [arguments...]

COMMANDS:
     create  Create target object
     list    Lists all targets currently active on the upstreamâ€™s load balancing wheel
     delete  Disable a target in the load balancer

OPTIONS:
   --help, -h  show help
```

example:

```
kongctl target create --upstream_id=c3cdc9e6-135e-4f6e-9249-791a7ccc9270 --target=xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8080

response body:
{
	"created_at": 1553934934921,
	"weight": 100,
	"upstream_id": "c3cdc9e6-135e-4f6e-9249-791a7ccc9270",
	"target": "xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8080",
	"id": "badf8d0d-d9c4-432d-b784-ce38fbbbff7b"
}
```

### Plugin Object

A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add functionalities to Services that run behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting for example. You can find more information about how to install and what values each plugin takes by visiting the Kong Hub.


```
kongctl plugin
NAME:
   kongctl plugin - The kong plugin object.

   kongctl plugin command [command options] [arguments...]

     list              list all plugins object
     delete            delete a plugin object

   --help, -h  show help
```

```
